      Hi, I'm a <strong>beginner</strong>

    <!-- Its important that we not use <i> for italics and <b> for bold,
        rather we use <em> and <strong> because say we wanted to add color
        or font or other change along with it...using em or strong is better 
        suited for adding such extra attributes without loosing meaning-->
    <p>
      I am a beginner web developer and interested in getting a job as a
      software engineer in the future. <br />I'm working on my resume and
      practising DSA for interviews. Hoping that doing projects will help in
      this process.
