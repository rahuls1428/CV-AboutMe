# CV-AboutMe

Hi, I am adding a small blurb here after having uploaded the files necessary for hosting a website. 
I will commit this lines-of-text (which u can see, i have written right now) explaining the project 
AFTER I haved finished writing the paragraph.

The reason for an about README.md file is to explain what the uploaded files/repository/project is about.
In that vain, I have created a bare bones pure HTML personal website using lessons taught from the WebDev 
course taught by Angela Yu on udemy.
